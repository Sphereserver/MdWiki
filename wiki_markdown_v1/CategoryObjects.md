Objects are \'things\' that exist inside Sphere and can be controlled
during runtime. Modifying the property of an object will only affect a
single instance (for example, setting the colour of one pile of gold to
blue will not result in all gold turning blue).

Some objects may need definitions, for example an
[item](Items "wikilink") has its basic properties defined by an
[ITEMDEF](ITEMDEF "wikilink") block and a [region](Regions "wikilink")
is defined by an [AREADEF](AREADEF "wikilink") block.

exist in Sphere, and what functions, properties and references can be
used to manipulate them.
