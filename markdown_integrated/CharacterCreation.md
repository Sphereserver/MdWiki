# Character Creation

This page describes various aspects of character creation within Sphere.

## Features

- **Extra Roleplay Faces**: The `FEATURE_EXTRA_ROLEPLAYFACES` setting in `sphere.ini` enables additional roleplay face styles for character creation on enhanced clients. These work similarly to hairs/beards; just create the item and equip it on the character.
