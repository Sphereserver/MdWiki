## Description

Memory flags are used to store various temporary states or relationships between objects.

## Flags

-   `MEMORY_IRRITATEDBY`: Added when a character receives a hit, is provoked, is attacked (even if hit not landed), or has their pack snooped.
-   `MEMORY_AGGREIVED`: Added when a character is provoked or starts to attack another character.

## Notes
- `MEMORY_WAR_TARG` is no longer used, as targets are now handled by the `Attacker` system.
