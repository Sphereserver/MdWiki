Because the SphereWiki is maintained by the Sphere community and not by
the Sphere developers (they may drop in from time to time, but are under
no obligation to do so), we welcome all the help that we can get to
improve the site.

All you need to do to contribute is [create an
account](Special:UserLogin "wikilink") and away you go! An "Edit" tab
will appear at the top of every page once you're logged in, and you'll
be able to edit any and every page to your heart's content.

Some ideas for contributing could be, but not necessarily limited to:

- Correcting mistakes in existing pages.
- Writing Sphere or UO related article(s).
- Updating the [Reference
  Compendium](Main_Page#Reference_Compendium "wikilink"), since it
  quickly becomes out of date at each Sphere release.

Regardless of what kind of contribution you make, please try to bear in
mind the following guidelines:

- Ensure your information is accurate and up-to-date.
- Write as clearly as possible - remember that not everybody is fully
  fluent in English so use *real, complete words*. Shortened words,
  phonetic spelling and "internet speak" (e.g. "u", "rec", "w8") won't
  be easily translated.
- Other people may not appreciate you editing their hard work. If you
  want to make substantial modifications to someone's article then you
  may want to consider speaking with them first.

If you want to contribute but aren't sure of what to do, here are some
ideas:

- Check the list of [wanted pages](Special:WantedPages "wikilink").
  These are pages that have not yet been written yet but people have
  linked to in other articles.
- Check the list of [wanted
  categories](Special:WantedCategories "wikilink"). These are categories
  that have not yet been written yet but people have linked to in other
  articles.

If you're not familiar with editing pages using the wiki language then
you can find help in the [Editing help](Help:Editing "wikilink") page.
The [Editing help](Help:Editing "wikilink") page also documents any
custom wiki markup tags for SphereWiki so even familiar users may want
to quickly check it out.
