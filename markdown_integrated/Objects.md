Objects are 'things' that exist inside Sphere and can be controlled
during runtime. Modifying the property of an object will only affect a
single instance (for example, setting the colour of one pile of gold to
blue will not result in all gold turning blue).

Some objects may need definitions, for example an
[item](./Items.md) has its basic properties defined by an
[ITEMDEF](./ITEMDEF.md) block and a [region](./Regions.md)
is defined by an [AREADEF](./AREADEF.md) block.

exist in Sphere, and what functions, properties and references can be
used to manipulate them.
