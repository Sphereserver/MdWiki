__FORCETOC__
Within [[Regions|regions]] you can also define rooms, which are basically 'sub-regions' that exist inside the area which may represent buildings within a town or a boss room within a dungeon. Rooms are almost identical to region.

'''Sphere 56b'''
 ROOMDEF  cannot possess events, triggers or tags.
'''Since Sphere56c (20 July 2013)'''
 ROOMDEF can have events, triggers and tags.

The syntax for defining a room is as follows:


<tt>
[ROOMDEF ''defname'']<br />
RECT=''left, top, right, bottom, map''<br />
RECT=''left, top, right, bottom, map''<br />
RECT=''left, top, right, bottom, map''<br />
</tt>
