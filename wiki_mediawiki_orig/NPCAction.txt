==Description==
This trigger fires when an NPC is making a decision to perform an AI action.

The revision notes for this trigger say "This trigger will fire only if EF_NPCAct_Triggers is set and EF_Minimize_Triggers is NOT set in the sphere.ini file...", however in more recent versions this trigger may be controlled by the NPC_AI_EXTRA setting.

AI-related trigger. If the situation is such that the NPC will do something due to it's AI - things like animals pooping the ground, vendors going off/on duty, (un)equipping a lightsource when it's dark, (un)equipping a weapon when fighting, stabler feeding animals or giving players food for their animals etc... this trigger will be fired.

On RETURN 0 the NPC will continue with what it wants to do, RETURN 1 will abort it.
