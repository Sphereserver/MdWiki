__FORCETOC__
==Exit Codes==
When Sphere closes, an 'exit code' will normally be shown in the console to describe why it is being shut down. In general, an exit code less than 0 is considered to be an error code, and values above 0 are normal shutdown codes. In most cases, a more descriptive error will be shown in the console and/or log file to help better diagnose the reason behind error codes.


The following table lists all of the current codes and their meanings.

==Garbage Collection==
The purpose of garbage collection is to validate all of the server objects and free up unused UIDs. Garbage collection is initiated:
* After the world save is loaded at startup.
* Before a world save begins, if the [[FORCEGARBAGECOLLECT]] setting is enabled in Sphere.ini.
* After the [[IMPORT]] or [[RESTORE]] functions have been used on the [[Server|server]] object.
* When the 'G' command is entered via the Sphere console
* When the [[GARBAGE]] function is used on the [[Server|server]] object.


When garbage collection encounters a problem with an object it may attempt to automatically correct the error, otherwise the object will be removed. When an object is removed by garbage collection there will normally be an error shown in the console describing the item that was removed along with the reason. The following table lists all of the garbage collection codes along with their description:

'''Note''': ''Garbage collection codes marked with * generally indicate a serious error within an object's internal state and should not normally be seen. If you are experiencing and are able to reliably reproduce any such errors then please report the details to the [http://tracker.sphere.torfo.org/bugs/main_page.php bug tracker].''
