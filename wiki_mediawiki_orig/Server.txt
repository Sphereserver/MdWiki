__FORCETOC__
The server object is a global object that can be accessed from any script, by using the SERV reference. The following tables detail the various properties of the server in SphereServer:

==References==
References return pointers to other objects (e.g. the CHAR.n reference allows you to access the characters that are attached to the account). These can either be accessed by using ''&lt;REFNAME&gt;'' to return the [[UID]] (1 for object types that don't have UIDs) of the object or 0 if it doesn't exist, or by using ''&lt;REFNAME.KEY&gt;'' where KEY is a valid property/function/reference for the ''REFNAME'' object. Click on the name for more detailed information such as usage and examples.
