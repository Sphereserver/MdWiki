{{Languages|Special_Items}}

Certain types of items have extended functionality, and therefore have additional properties, functions or references to the ones already listed on the [[Items]] page. The following sections describe what these are.


==Multis==
Multis have a TYPE t_multi, t_multi_custom or t_ship. These are multi-piece items that are usually stored in the client's multi.mul file, but are only considered to be one item to both the server and client (so when you approach a castle, there is a significant reduction in lag since the server doesn't have to tell the client to display thousands of wall pieces).

===Properties and Functions===
Here is a list of all multi properties and functions. If a function is marked as readable then it can return a value when used as &lt;KEY&gt;. Click on the name for more detailed information such as usage and examples.

{| border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4"
| '''Name''' || '''Read/Write''' || '''Description'''
|-
| [[COMPS]] || R || Gets the number of components defined in the [[ITEMDEF]].
|-
| [[COMP]]''.n.key'' || R || Gets the KEY (ID,DX,DY,DZ,D) of the nth component defined in the [[ITEMDEF]].
|-
| [[MULTICREATE]] ''owner_uid'' || W || When a multi is created via SERV.[[NEWITEM]], this function must be used to initialise the multi-region.
|}


==Customizable Multis==
Customizable multis are represented by the TYPE of t_multi_custom. These are designed to be used with the AOS House Designer tool that is present since the 4.0.0 series of UO clients.

===References===
References return pointers to other objects (e.g. the REGION reference allows you to access the REGION that an object is in). These can either be accessed by using ''&lt;REFNAME&gt;'' to return the [[UID]] (1 for object types that don't have UIDs) of the object or 0 if it doesn't exist, or by using ''&lt;REFNAME.KEY&gt;'' where KEY is a valid property/function/reference for the ''REFNAME'' object. Click on the name for more detailed information such as usage and examples.

When accessing a member of a guild or town via the [[MEMBER]].x,r [[MEMBERFROMUID]].uid, [[GUILD]].x, or [[GUILDFROMUID]].uid references, you access a special "Guild/Town Member" object which has specific properties, references and functions available. If you attempt to access something that doesn't exist in any of the following tables then the command is 'redirected' to the actual character or item the member object is linked to (so something like ''&lt;MEMBER.x.STR&gt;'' would work because the STR property exists on the [[Characters|character]]).
