__FORCETOC__
Player characters are attached to accounts. The account object can be referenced by using ''ACCOUNT.KEY'' from the character object or ''ACCOUNT.name_or_index.KEY'' from the server object. The following tables detail the various properties of accounts in SphereServer:


==References==
References return pointers to other objects (e.g. the CHAR.n reference allows you to access the characters that are attached to the account). These can either be accessed by using ''&lt;REFNAME&gt;'' to return the [[UID]] (1 for object types that don't have UIDs) of the object or 0 if it doesn't exist, or by using ''&lt;REFNAME.KEY&gt;'' where KEY is a valid property/function/reference for the ''REFNAME'' object. Click on the name for more detailed information such as usage and examples.
