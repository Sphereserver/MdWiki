==Description==
This trigger fires when a player exceeds the walking limit defined by the WALKBUFFER and WALKREGEN settings in Sphere.ini. This could indicate that the player is using a cheat to run faster than they should (i.e. speedhacking) or it could be a result of a poor connection between the server and client.

* [[Characters#Players|Players]]
