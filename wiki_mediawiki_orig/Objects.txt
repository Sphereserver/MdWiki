Objects are 'things' that exist inside Sphere and can be controlled during runtime. Modifying the property of an object will only affect a single instance (for example, setting the colour of one pile of gold to blue will not result in all gold turning blue).


Some objects may need definitions, for example an [[Items|item]] has its basic properties defined by an [[ITEMDEF]] block and a [[Regions|region]] is defined by an [[AREADEF]] block.
