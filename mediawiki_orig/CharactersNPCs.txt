__FORCETOC__
A character can be either a player or an NPC.

==References==
References return pointers to other objects (e.g. the REGION reference allows you to access the REGION that an object is in). These can either be accessed by using ''&lt;REFNAME&gt;'' to return the [[UID]] (1 for object types that don't have UIDs) of the object or 0 if it doesn't exist, or by using ''&lt;REFNAME.KEY&gt;'' where KEY is a valid property/function/reference for the ''REFNAME'' object.
