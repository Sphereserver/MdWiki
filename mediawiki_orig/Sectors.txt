__FORCETOC__
The world is split into fixed-size sectors (by default, 64x64 tiles). Environmental settings (light, weather, etc) are stored on a per-sector basis. Accessing sectors in scripts can be accomplished using the SECTOR reference from a [[Characters|character]], [[Items|item]] or [[Map Points|map point]] object. The following table details the various properties of the sector object in SphereServer:
