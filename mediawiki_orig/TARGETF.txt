Targetf is a command you can use to directly target a character or item and using a function on it without manually creating an memory item or such. Using the targetf itself works like calling an ordinary function and you can put arguments after the function normally. 

ex. targetf f_hello or targetf f_hello 1,2 

In targetf: 

SRC= player using the function 

ARGO= target's UID

TARGP= ID of the tiles when target is a static tile

local.id stores the ID of the targeted object
