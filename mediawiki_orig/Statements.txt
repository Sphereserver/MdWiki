| '''Statement''' || '''End Statement''' || '''Description'''
|-
| [[BEGIN]] || END || Groups a set of lines together, for use with [[DORAND]] and [[DOSWITCH]] statements.
|-
| [[DORAND]] ''line_count'' || ENDDO || Executes a random line of code within the block.
|-
| [[DOSWITCH]] ''line_number'' || ENDDO || Executes the specified line of code within the block.
|-
| [[FOR]] ''start end'' || ENDFOR || Loops through the block of code
|-
| [[FORCHARLAYER]] ''layer_id'' || ENDFOR || Loops through all items that a character has equipped on a specified layer.
|-
| [[FORCHARMEMORYTYPE]] ''memory_flags'' || ENDFOR || Loops through all memory items on a character that have one of the specified flags.
|-
| [[FORCHARS]] ''distance'' || ENDFOR || Loops through all characters within ''distance'' tiles.
|-
| [[FORCLIENTS]] ''distance'' || ENDFOR || Loops through all connected clients within ''distance'' tiles.
|-
| [[FORCONT]] ''container_uid, max_subcontainers'' || ENDFOR || Loops through all items inside a container.
|-
| [[FORCONTID]] ''item_id, max_subcontainers'''' || ENDFOR || Loops through all items inside a container with a specified [[BASEID]]
|-
| [[FORCONTTYPE]] ''type, max_subcontainers'' || ENDFOR || Loops through all items inside a container with a specified [[TYPE]]
|-
| [[FORINSTANCES]] ''defname'' || ENDFOR || Loops through all instances of characters or items with the specified [[BASEID]]
|-
| [[FORITEMS]] ''distance'' || ENDFOR || Loops through all items within ''distance'' tiles.
|-
| [[FOROBJS]] ''distance'' || ENDFOR || Loops through all items and players within ''distance'' tiles.
|-
| [[FORPLAYERS]] ''distance'' || ENDFOR || Loops through all players (online and offline) within ''distance'' tiles.
|-
| [[IF]] ''condition''<br />[[IF|ELIF]] ''condition''<br />[[IF|ELSEIF]] ''condition'' || ENDIF || Executes the block of code if ''condition'' is true.
|-
| [[WHILE]] ''condition'' || ENDWHILE || Loops through the block of code whilst ''condition'' is true.
|-
| <local._for> || || Current Step of the Loop for the FOR statements.  Note, not all of the FOR statements use this concept... for example, in a FORITEMS statement, the <local._for> counter will always be zero no matter how many objects the statement loops over.
|-
| <local._while> || || Current Step of the Loop for the WHILE statement.
