__FORCETOC__
Within [[Regions|regions]] you can also define rooms, which are basically 'sub-regions' that exist inside the area which may represent buildings within a town or a boss room within a dungeon. Accessing rooms in scripts can be accomplished using the ROOM reference from a [[Characters|character]], [[Items|item]] or [[Map Points|map point]] object, or the ROOM.room_id reference from the [[Server|server]] object. The following table details the various properties of the room object in SphereServer:


==Properties and Functions==
Here is a list of all room properties and functions. If a function is marked as readable then it can return a value when used as <KEY>. Click on the name for more detailed information such as usage and examples. The properties from the [[ROOMDEF|room definition]] can also be accessed from the room object. If an attempt is made to execute (not read) a command that does not exist on the room, then the command will be called on all sectors that touch the room area.
