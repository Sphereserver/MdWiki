==Examples==

This first example shows a "base" CHARDEF... these are identified by the fact that the CHARDEF keyword is followed by a number:

<spherescript>[CHARDEF 01]        // This is a "base" chardef for character animation 01 (from the mul/uop files)
// This is the start of the "base" properties.
// Values set in the base properties cannot have a range (you cannot use {1 10})
