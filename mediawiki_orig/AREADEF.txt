__FORCETOC__
Areas in the world, such as dungeons and cities are defined by regions. Regions are constructed from one or more "rectangles" on the map.


The basic syntax for definining a region is as follows:


<tt>
[AREADEF ''defname'']<br />
RECT=''left, top, right, bottom, map''<br />
RECT=''left, top, right, bottom, map''<br />
RECT=''left, top, right, bottom, map''<br />
</tt>
