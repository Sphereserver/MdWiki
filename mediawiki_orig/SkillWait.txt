==Description==
This trigger is used in character definitions (a related [[@Wait]] exists for skill definitions). This trigger is called whenever Sphere wants to check if a character must wait before starting a skill. Normally this will be when a skill is selected from the skill menu (before [[@Select]]), but also when snooping a container or using a musical instrument.
