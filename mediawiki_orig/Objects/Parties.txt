__FORCETOC__
Clients are able to form parties with each other by using the <tt>/add</tt> command. When in a party, the party object can be referenced by using '''PARTY.KEY''' from the [[Characters#Clients|client]] object. The following tables detail the various properties of parties in SphereServer:


==References==
References return pointers to other objects (e.g. the CHAR.n reference allows you to access the characters that are attached to the account). These can either be accessed by using ''&lt;REFNAME&gt;'' to return the [[UID]] (1 for object types that don't have UIDs) of the object or 0 if it doesn't exist, or by using ''&lt;REFNAME.KEY&gt;'' where KEY is a valid property/function/reference for the ''REFNAME'' object. Click on the name for more detailed information such as usage and examples.
