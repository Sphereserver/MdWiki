__FORCETOC__
A map point is a specific location on a world map, defined by X, Y, Z and M coordinates. Map point references, such as ''P'' from the [[Characters|character]]/[[Items|item]] object and ''MAP(x,y,map)'' from the [[Server|server]] object can be used to access additional information about a map point such as what static items exist at the location. The following tables detail the various properties of map points in SphereServer:


==References==
References return pointers to other objects (e.g. the REGION reference allows you to access the region that contains the map point). These can either be accessed by using ''&lt;REFNAME&gt;'' to return the [[UID]] (1 for object types that don't have UIDs) of the object or 0 if it doesn't exist, or by using ''&lt;REFNAME.KEY&gt;'' where KEY is a valid property/function/reference for the ''REFNAME'' object. Click on the name for more detailed information such as usage and examples.

| '''Name''' || '''Read/Write''' || '''Description'''
|-
| [[REGION]] || R || Gets the [[Regions|region]] that contains the map point.
|-
| [[ROOM]] || R || Gets the [[Rooms|room]] that contains the map point.

==Properties and Functions==
Here is a list of all map point properties and functions. If a function is marked as readable then it can return a value when used as <KEY>. Click on the name for more detailed information such as usage and examples.
