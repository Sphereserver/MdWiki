Scripts are used to control what actions take place when certain things happen. For example a script can be used to control what happens when a player double clicks a certain object. Through the use of scripts, Sphere can be customised in a very particular way that should meet the needs of virtually any server.


The [[:Category:Definitions|Definitions]] category describes how scripts can be used to define the basic properties of objects, and the [[:Category:Objects|Objects]] category describes each of the different types of object and how they can be manipulated by scripts.


The pages in this category describe more general information about scripts, such as global properties and functions that are available from any script in Sphere, as well as the arguments that are available when creating scripting functions and triggers.
