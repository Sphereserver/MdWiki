==Description==
X branch only. The trigger is fired before the trigger @(Skill)UseQuick for parrying is succesfull. By default a parried hit will reduce the damage by 100% and thus negating the hit and the following triggers (@Hit and so on).

There are two for changing the damage reduced:

* Overwriting the Argn1 value in the @HitParry trigger.

* By using the EFFECT property in the skill definition of the Parrying Skill, in this case the damage will be reduced by the EFFECT value:
- If only one values is defined (Example:EFFECT=75) the damage will always be reduced by 75% no matter skills.

- If one or more values are defined (Example: EFFECT=25,75) the damage will be reduced by 25% when the Parrying skill is near 0.0 and by 75% when the Parrying skill is near 100.0, that is damage reduction will be scaled according to the character parrying skill.

- If no values are defined, the default value of 100 will be used.
