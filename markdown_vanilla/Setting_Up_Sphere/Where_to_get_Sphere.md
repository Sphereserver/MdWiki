There are two different sources for downloading Sphere: Pre-Releases and
Automated Builds. Below is a summary of what each is to help you choose
between them.

## Prerelease Builds

Prerelease builds are periodically released when the Sphere developers
feel that enough progress has been made and are relatively happy with
the stability of the build (i.e. the build actually runs!). Since there
is not yet a "final" build of Sphere, the prereleases are the closest
"Stable" thing that you can get.

Visit the
[Pre-releases](https://forum.spherecommunity.net/sshare.php?srt=4)
website to find the latest prerelease download for Sphere. There
different Version but Sphere X is the more recent, more performant and
the one where there some active dev.

This build is more than likely the one you want to download. *If you are
unsure, then review the [Which Do I Want?](#Which_Do_I_Want? "wikilink")
section for more information.*

## Automated Builds

on every modification an automated process will compile a new Sphere
executable directly from the latest development code. If you want the
latest cutting edge features that aren't available in the latest
prerelease then you may want to consider using an automated build.

Visit the [SphereServer Nightly Automated
Builds](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cbnolok/sphereserver-x/history)
website to download all latest automated build for Sphere.

Before you rush over and download an automated build, take care of the
following warnings:

- Since these builds are compiled directly from the latest development
  source code, it is not recommended that you use these at all on a live
  server unless you know exactly what you are doing and have performed
  thorough tests first!
- The Sphere development team will not provide any support for using
  these builds. If you encounter a problem then you will be completely
  on your own.

## Which Do I Want?

If you're unsure of which to use the best option is to simply use the
latest prerelease. Automated builds are only intended to be used by
advanced users or testers, who may want to test some of the newer
features before they are released.

Here is a brief comparison of the two build types:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| **[Prerelease Builds](#Prerelease_Builds "wikilink")** | **[Automated Builds](#Automated_Builds "wikilink")** |
| Support available in \[<https://discord.gg/NufqpAw%5DDiscord> or the Forum | No support available at all |
| Increased chance of stability | Decreased chance of stability |
| Compiled manually from a more stable code branch | Compiled automatically from the development code branch |
| Does not contain the very latest features and bugfixes | Contains the very latest features and bugfixes |
| Released periodically (sometimes months apart) | Released daily |

To summarise, the prerelease builds are supported and specifically
released by the Sphere development team at appropriate times when it is
felt that enough development work has been made for a new release to be
worthwhile. Unless you urgently need an as-of-yet unreleased feature or
bugfix there should be no reason for you, as an end-user, to want to
download an automated build.

***Note:*** *If your only reason for choosing to use an automated Sphere
build is that you don't want to wait for an official prerelease
containing a new feature or bugfix then you should reconsider this
decision. Whilst you may enjoy having the feature or bugfix in question,
there is also an increased chance that some of the work has not been
completed, or a new bug may have been introduced, which could
consequently destabalise your server!*
