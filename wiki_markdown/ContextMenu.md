## Description

This document describes the Context Menu (or Popup Menu) functionality, specifically how the hardcoded train and tame functions have been modified.

## Functions

-   **Train**: The hardcoded train function for the Context Menu has been modified.
-   **Tame**: The hardcoded tame function for the Context Menu has been modified.

## Notes
- These modifications allow for the removal of `e_Trainer` from every NPC, as the train and tame functions are now handled directly by the Context Menu.
