# ID

This property gets or sets the ID of an item or character.

## Ficha

|              |             |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Property** | **ID**      |
| **Type**     | Item, Character |
| **Access**   | Read/Write  |
| **Sphere X** | Yes           |

## Notes
- The ID of an item can be overridden after its creation by a random template. This template must return a non-container type item. However, this method is considered inefficient; using a `{ }` random range is the preferred approach.
