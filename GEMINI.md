# About the repo

We are porting an old MediaWiki for **SphereServer** main features and scripting language (**SphereScript**).
We have fetched and converted the old content to **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)** and linked the pages.
The `Changelog.txt` file contains changes to the C++ core and SphereScript features relevant to end-users (game masters, scripters, admins). Information relevant for maintainers is stored elsewhere.

# General Rules

- Do **not** add information about implementation details or inner workings relevant only to C++ source code contributors.
- **Preserve Case:** SphereScript keywords/acronyms are often **UPPERCASE** or **PascalCase**.
- **Markdown Files Case**: Always use PascalCase for markdown wiki file names.
- Preserve **formatting**: use tables or bullet points as appropriate, keeping intact the style of the MediaWiki source.
- **Tool Parameter Constraint:** When using any file manipulation tool (like `WriteFile`, `ReadFile`, or `EditFile`), you **must** explicitly include the `file_path` argument, even if the file is already referenced in context.
- **Progress Tracking:**
    - Every time you log a block of output (an answer of yours), execute the following shell command **immediately before the output** to print the **client local time**: `(Current time is $(date +%T.%3N))`

## File Handling & Context Management (Critical)
- **Mandatory Editing Tool Hierarchy:**
     1.  **Priority 1 (High Efficiency Logic Offloading):** For implementing complex logic (like data processing or file organization), prefer using **dedicated Python scripts** in the `agent_helpers/` folder (e.g., `process_changelog.py`, `organize_wiki.py`) to handle the work on the client. For simple, atomic data queries (e.g., `grep` for context), use Unix shell commands. Prefer it to using your "SearchText" tool.
     2.  **Priority 2 (Reliability):** For **ALL** file content modifications (replacements, insertions, or deletions) that require precise string matching, you **MUST** use the dedicated Python script, **`agent_helpers/file_editor.py`**. Usage: `python3 agent_helpers/file_editor.py <filepath> --old "old_string" --new "new_string"`. This is extremely beneficial because you won't need anymore to read the whole md file multiple times to edit it, so your context won't be polluted. If available features are not sufficient, stop and ask the user if you should expand it, informing also about how you will implement the script.
- **Context Isolation & Token Management:** **NEVER** read an entire file unless absolutely necessary. After successfully performing an edit on a file, **do not read that file again** in the current batch unless it is the explicit target of a subsequent operation. Assume the change was successful and avoid polluting the context with redundant file content.
- **Content Editing Workflow:**
    - **Step 1 (Find Context):** Before proposing an edit, use the most scoped method possible (e.g., grep or a targeted read_file) to fetch only the specific block containing your intended old_string. This step is for verifying context and generating the old_string argument for file_editor.py.
    - **Step 2 (Execute Edit):** Execute the required replacement using `python3 agent_helpers/file_editor.py`.
    - **Step 3 (Failure Handling):** If `file_editor.py` reports "0 occurrences found", immediately read the entire file content using the read_file tool and ask me for a new plan or confirmation. Do not attempt to correct the old_string yourself.
- **SphereScript Code Handling:**
    - Do NOT assume, best guess or hallucinate language grammar or features. If not sure of the correctness of what you are writing, try to stick with the exact sentences the Changelog or the existing md wiki text are using for that topic. If still unsure, do not add ex novo (100% reasoned and produced by you) code or examples.

# Tasks

## Task 1) Done

>! Create a **new Python script**, starting from `agent_helpers/download_mediawiki.py`, to download the mediawiki files from the old wiki and put them into the folder `mediawiki_orig`. Old wiki address: `https://wiki.spherecommunity.net/index.php?title=Main_Page`

## Task 2) Done

>! Convert the original mediawiki files from the `mediawiki_orig` folder into markdown files in the `mediawiki_orig_conv_markdown` folder through the python script `agent_helpers/convert_mediawiki_to_md.py`, which leverages `pandoc` for the conversion.

## Task 3) Done

>! If missing, retrieve the missing root pages (e.g., `Category*.md`) from the `mediawiki_orig_conv_markdown` folder and expand them if needed, linking to their child pages.

## Task 4) Current, not yet completed.

**Update the wiki content using the `Changelog.txt`** (Long-Running Task).
- **Work Folder**: `markdown_integrated`.
- **Goal:**
    - Expand wiki entries/tables/infos to incorporate new features or reflect changes that affect correctness (e.g., parameter shifts like ARGN2 to ARGN3).
    - Do **NOT** add informations about existing features fixes.
    - If there's a change on how a feature works, do not mention both the old and the new feature usage. Keep only the latest.
- **Tool for Progress & Batching:**
    You must use the existing Python script `agent_helpers/process_changelog.py` for all changelog management.
    - **Initial Setup:** The script is responsible for creating and maintaining `agent_helpers/changelog_progress.txt`.
    - **Batch Selection:** Use a command-line argument (e.g., `--start-point-header`) to instruct the script to find the next uncompleted entry and output a batch of **5 entries** to integrate into the wiki.
    - **Progress Tracking:** After successfully integrating a batch, use another command-line argument to instruct the script to apply **strike-through formatting** to those completed entries in the **`changelog_progress.txt`** file.
    - Usage:
        - "--start-point-header": Changelog entry header (e.g., '01-06-2019, Nolok') to start processing from.
        - ""--mark-as-processed": Mark the last processed batch of entries as complete in changelog_progress.txt.
- **Content Creation:**
    - Only integrate changes of **functionalities** (new, removal, or change) that are relevant to end-users; ignore vague fixes or simple bugfixes.
    - If a page doesn't exist, **create and link it to the relevant parent page** only if you have sufficient, relevant information. New pages must contain **at least one parameter table and 1-2 paragraphs** of useful information. Do not create mostly empty pages.
- **Verification & Constraint:**
    - Do not add the date a feature had changed. Assume the wiki is always updated to the latest build.
    - Check if the reason your file manipulation tools are failing is simply because a file **does not exist**.
    - Make sure that any files you are adding new links to **do really exist** and have the correct, non-hallucinated content.
- **Execution Plan:** **Continue with every unaddressed changelog entry** (as indicated by `agent_helpers/changelog_progress.txt`), taking the time you need and proceeding without supervision.

## Task 5) TODO.

Stop your actions and wait for user input. We will need to change the model (use here gemini-2.5-pro, for everything else continue using gemini-2.5-flash).
Review and fix the links you inserted between pages, as most have a **broken format** (e.g., an unnecessary leading `:`). Moreover, for each markdown "root" file (has multiple links to other pages, and the other pages are "children" and do have only one root file), create a folder with the "root" markdown file name. Keep every child file in that folder. Subfolders are allowed.
- **Mandatory Tool for Restructuring:** You MUST use the script `agent_helpers/organize_wiki.py` to perform the file restructuring (right now it is only a blueprint, you need to complete it). The script handles finding root files, creating folders named after the root file, and moving all child pages into that new folder structure.
## Task 6) TODO.

Read every **Sphere.ini** setting and add it to the wiki in the relevant page, if missing.

## Task 7) TODO.

**Post-Processing Pass:** After all other tasks are complete, perform a single, full review of all modified/created files to ensure:
1. **Consistent Markdown Headings** (e.g., no excessive deep nesting like `#######`).
2. **Consistent Use of SphereScript/C++ Terminology** (e.g., `SphereScript` is correctly capitalized).
3. **No Redundant or Repetitive Information** was added during the batch processing of Task 3.
